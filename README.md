## Automatic "sleep" prevention
In heroku's free program, the server shuts down after 30 minutes without any external request to the server. This can be circumvented by verifying credit in the Harco account , thus getting a total of 1000 free hours per month, which is enough for continuous application of the app. Then a "dummy request" should be sent to the app every less than 30 minutes. This can be easily done through one of the following sites :

https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com
https://www.downnotifier.com

## Create a fixed token:
First of all, install the heroku cli ([ for Windows 64-bit](https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x64.exe))

Then login to heroku account:

heroku login
And token creation:

heroku authorizations:create
